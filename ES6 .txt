Certainly! Here are the answers to the questions you provided:

1. **What are the new features introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)?**
   ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, introduced several new features, including:
   - `let` and `const` for variable declaration
   - Arrow functions
   - Classes and enhanced object literals
   - Template literals
   - Destructuring assignment
   - Default function parameters
   - Spread and rest operators
   - Modules
   - Promises for asynchronous programming
   - `async/await` for asynchronous operations
   - And more!

2. **Explain the purpose of let and const in ES6.**
   - `let`: Used to declare block-scoped variables that can be reassigned.
   - `const`: Also declares block-scoped variables, but the value cannot be reassigned after declaration.

3. **What are arrow functions? How do they differ from regular functions?**
   Arrow functions are a shorter syntax for defining functions in ES6. They have a more concise syntax, don't bind their own `this`, and can't be used as constructors.

4. **How do you use the spread operator (...) and rest parameters in ES6?**
   - Spread Operator (`...`): Used to expand elements of an iterable (like an array) into individual elements.
   - Rest Parameters (`...` in function parameters): Used to collect multiple function arguments into an array.

5. **Explain the concept of destructuring assignment in ES6.**
   Destructuring assignment allows you to extract values from arrays or objects and assign them to variables in a more concise way.

6. **What are template literals in ES6 and how do they work?**
   Template literals are string literals that support embedded expressions. They are enclosed by backticks (\`) and allow you to interpolate variables and expressions directly into the string.

7. **How do you create and use classes in ES6?**
   ES6 introduced the `class` syntax for creating and defining classes. Classes are used as blueprints to create objects with shared properties and methods.

8. **Explain the concept of modules in ES6.**
   Modules in ES6 allow you to organize code into separate files and export/import functionality between them. This helps in maintaining and organizing large codebases.

9. **What are the Promise and async/await features in ES6 for handling asynchronous operations?**
   - Promises: Provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations and avoid callback hell.
   - `async/await`: ES8 feature that provides a more synchronous-like syntax for writing asynchronous code using Promises.

10. **How do you use the fetch API for making HTTP requests?**
    The `fetch` API is used to make HTTP requests. It returns a Promise that resolves to the response of the request. It provides a modern alternative to `XMLHttpRequest`.

   ```javascript
   fetch(url)
     .then(response => response.json())
     .then(data => console.log(data))
     .catch(error => console.error("Error:", error));
   ```
